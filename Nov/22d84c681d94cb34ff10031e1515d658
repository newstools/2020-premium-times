Nigeria’s new COVID-19 infections increased last week, a PREMIUM TIMES review of official data shows. Last week was the second consecutive weekly increase In new infections, suggesting a possible resurgence in COVID-19 cases after weeks of low numbers. Last week (November 1-7), the 45th week of the pandemic in Nigeria, the country recorded 937 new cases, a two per cent increase from the previous week’s record of 923 cases which was a 32 per cent increase from the preceding week. While the preceding week’s increase occurred despite a reduction in testing figures, last week’s occurred amidst a significant increase in the number of tests conducted. Last week’s two per cent increase in new cases occurred amid over 100 per cent increase in the number of tests carried out. A total of 56,089 samples were collected for testing last week as against the 21,899 tested the previous week. A total 681,599 samples have been collected for testing since the pandemic broke out in Nigeria February. Both Nigerians and the government seem to be lax about adhering to and enforcing COVID-19 safety protocols. This weekly update is coming about two weeks after the #EndSARS protest, in which Nigerian youth demanded the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigeria police. Thousands of youth trooped out across the country especially from its capital, Abuja, and the commercial nerve, Lagos, defying repeated calls by the country’s infectious disease outfit, NCDC, and health experts to avoid mass gathering. Several COVID-19 protocols including the use of face masks and maintenance of social distancing were breached as there were mammoth crowds of protesters packed in tight spaces without face masks. Similar situations occurred in Ondo and Edo states where governorship elections were held and large political gatherings held without social distancing and use of face masks. <img data-attachment-id="425167" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/425162-weekly-review-nigerias-new-covid-19-cases-increase-for-second-consecutive-week.html/attachment/2472e2a0-8c4e-4f82-b059-2a435a948044-19" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/2472e2a0-8c4e-4f82-b059-2a435a948044-19.png?fit=1448%2C880&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1448,880" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="2472e2a0-8c4e-4f82-b059-2a435a948044 (19)" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/2472e2a0-8c4e-4f82-b059-2a435a948044-19.png?fit=526%2C320&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/2472e2a0-8c4e-4f82-b059-2a435a948044-19.png?fit=1448%2C880&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-425167" src="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/2472e2a0-8c4e-4f82-b059-2a435a948044-19.png?ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/2472e2a0-8c4e-4f82-b059-2a435a948044-19.png?w=1448&amp;ssl=1 1448w, https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/2472e2a0-8c4e-4f82-b059-2a435a948044-19.png?resize=526%2C320&amp;ssl=1 526w, https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/2472e2a0-8c4e-4f82-b059-2a435a948044-19.png?resize=768%2C467&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/2472e2a0-8c4e-4f82-b059-2a435a948044-19.png?resize=750%2C456&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i1.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/2472e2a0-8c4e-4f82-b059-2a435a948044-19.png?resize=1140%2C693&amp;ssl=1 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> In a recent interview with PREMIUM TIMES, the NCDC director-general, Chikwe Ihekweazu, said the impact of the demonstrations might not be felt now as COVID-19 symptoms may not have started developing. “It takes between two to 14 days for COVID-19 symptoms to develop in an infected person. In some others, they may not develop symptoms. So, we have to monitor this closely for the next two weeks”, he noted. While it is now over a month after the elections and the political gatherings have clearly had no effects on COVID-19 numbers from Edo and Ondo, the effect of the protests can not yet be effectively determined. Further analysis showed that there was a slight reduction in the number of COVID-19 patients discharged and the number of deaths recorded last week.   <img data-attachment-id="425165" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/425162-weekly-review-nigerias-new-covid-19-cases-increase-for-second-consecutive-week.html/attachment/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-29" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-29.png?fit=1500%2C1058&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1500,1058" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67 (29)" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-29.png?fit=495%2C349&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-29.png?fit=1500%2C1058&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-425165" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-29.png?ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-29.png?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-29.png?resize=495%2C349&amp;ssl=1 495w, https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-29.png?resize=768%2C542&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-29.png?resize=120%2C86&amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-29.png?resize=750%2C529&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-29.png?resize=1140%2C804&amp;ssl=1 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> A total of 1,209 persons recovered and were discharged last week, which represents a 13 per cent decrease when compared to the previous week’s record of 1,390.
