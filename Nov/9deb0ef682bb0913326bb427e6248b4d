He said many of the residents fled to the bush with bullet wounds and later returned from their hiding before going for treatment after the gunmen had left with many other congregants. ”The gunmen, on their way to Dutsen Gari community, freely attacked neighboring communities, rustled livestock and killed many before reaching our community unchallenged,” he said. The police in Zamfara said the gunmen earlier disguised as congregants in the mosque and later dispersed residents with gunshots killing five of them The police, however, said only 18 persons were abducted. The police spokesperson in Zamfara, Muhammad Shehu, told reporters that two persons died instantly following the gunshots while three others died while receiving treatment in the hospital. Police officers have been drafted to the area to trail the fleeing bandits, the spokesperson added. Zamfara is one of the North-west states affected by repeated bandit attacks. Others include Kaduna and Katsina. Apart from killing residents, the gunmen also kidnap many for ransom. Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .
