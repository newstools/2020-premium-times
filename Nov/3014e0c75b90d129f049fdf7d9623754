The chairman of the anti-graft agency, ICPC, Bolaji Owasanoye, was among 72 lawyers conferred with the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) on Friday. The Legal Practitioners’ Privileges Committee (LPPC) at its 143rd meeting held on Friday elevated the 72 lawyers to the Senior Advocate cadre, a statement signed by Festus Akande, on behalf of the committee secretary, said. The committee had in September shortlisted a total of 137 candidates, both at advocate filtration stages and academic pre-qualification exercise, for the conferment of the coveted SAN rank. The 72 successful candidates comprising 62 advocates and 10 in the academia, as against 30 in 2019, would be sworn in on December 14, the statement said. The LPPC meets annually to promote lawyers to the highly-coveted rank which often confers special privileges on holders, including prioritized call of their cases. “The rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria is awarded as a mark of excellence to members of the legal profession who have distinguished themselves as advocates and law academics,” Mr Akande said. Hajo Sarki, the acting Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court and Secretary, LPPC, had earlier stated that, “All qualified candidates shortlisted are graded under the category system of the Legal Practitioners’ Privileges Committee Guidelines, 2018”. She announced that the general public was at liberty to comment on the integrity, reputation and competence of the candidates, saying that any complaint (s) presented to the committee must be accompanied with a verifying affidavit deposed to before a Court of Record in Nigeria. Apart from Mr Owasanoye, some of those named in Friday’s statement include two former General Secretaries of the Nigerian Bar Association, Isiaka Olagunju, and Afam Osigwe. The statement also contained the name of a lawyer in the Federal Ministry of Justice, Tijjani Gazali; a former National Legal Adviser of the All Progressives Congress, Babatunde Ogala, and a former Dean of the Faculty of Law, University of Lagos, Oyelowo Oyewo (academics).
