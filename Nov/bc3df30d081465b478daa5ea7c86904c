The court had, on Nov. 26, 2019, admitted Mr Faisal to bail in the sum of N60 million with a surety in the like sum who must be a member of the House of Representatives. Mr Dan-Galadima had deposed to an affidavit of means, on Dec. 11, 2019, to always come to court at every adjourned date and produce Faisal in court. (NAN) Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .
