The two police officers, one inspector of police and a corporal, who were badly injured during the attack, were said to be receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital. PREMIUM TIMES learnt on Tuesday that the suspected armed robbers came to the police station at about 8 p.m. on Monday and threw an object, believed to be dynamite, into the station before gaining access. Following the explosion, the armed men, immediately they gained access to the building, headed for the armoury where the arms and ammunition were stolen.
