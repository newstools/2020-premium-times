The decrease in new cases last week might be as a result of the significant drop in the number of tests carried out. A total of 17,021 samples were collected for testing last week as against the 33,407 tested the previous week. This represents nearly 50 per cent reduction in the tests carried out. Since the pandemic broke out in February, a total of 756,237 samples have been collected for testing. PREMIUM TIMES’s analysis also showed that there was an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients discharged and deaths recorded last week. <img data-attachment-id="428608" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/health/health-news/428600-weekly-review-nigerias-new-covid-19-infections-reduce-after-four-consecutive-weeks-of-increase.html/attachment/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-32" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-32.png?fit=1500%2C1058&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1500,1058" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67 (32)" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-32.png?fit=495%2C349&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-32.png?fit=1500%2C1058&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-428608" src="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-32.png?ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-32.png?w=1500&amp;ssl=1 1500w, https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-32.png?resize=495%2C349&amp;ssl=1 495w, https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-32.png?resize=768%2C542&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-32.png?resize=120%2C86&amp;ssl=1 120w, https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-32.png?resize=750%2C529&amp;ssl=1 750w, https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/11/e4e9d5b8-e007-4a7f-85f3-2ea76ffb5a67-32.png?resize=1140%2C804&amp;ssl=1 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> A total of 935 persons recovered and were discharged last week, which represents an 8.5 per cent increase when compared to the previous week’s record of 855.
