Two of the victims were killed early Sunday in Gwer West Local Government Area while the other three, members of the same family, were killed in Katsina-ala Local Government Area, late on Saturday. The Benue police spokesperson, Catherine Anene, said the family members killed included a father, his wife and son in Nagu village of Katsina-ala. Ms Anene said the family members, whose surname was simply identified as Jato, were attacked and killed late Saturday night as they slept, but the attackers did not attack or injure any other persons.

Two persons were arrested at the scene of the crime, while two young men were found in a pool of blood. “The victims were rushed to the hospital but were confirmed dead.
