Some gunmen on Friday killed a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo State, Fatai Aborode. PREMIUM TIMES gathered that Mr Aborode was killed near his farm in Igangan town Friday evening. The politician contested the House of Representatives election on the platform of Accord Party in 2015. He recently left the Accord Party and joined the ruling Peoples Democratic Party in the state. Mr Aborode, who was the Chief Executive Officer, Kunfayakun Green Treasures Limited, was killed near his farm, along Apodun village in Iganagan.
