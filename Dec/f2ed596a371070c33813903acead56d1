Tottenham v Leicester City @Tottenham Stadium @3:15pm on Dec.20 After the disappointment of conceding that last-minute goal against Liverpool, Jose Mourinho needs to lift his team for the new test that is Leicester City. The Foxes, under Brendan Rodgers, have been better from home this season – winning five of their away matches. Mourinho could recall Tanguy Ndombele to the starting lineup while Rodgers will be happy to have his defensive organiser, Johnny Evans back after a one-match suspension. The last time Leicester beat Tottenham was in 2016 – their title-winning year, through a goal from Robert Huth, with seven minutes on the clock. That loss was a major reason Tottenham conceded the title to Leicester that season. Mourinho has reiterated that the “result in the end is the most important thing”. Both teams like the counter attack but will Tottenham as the home team concede that tactic to the visitors to get on the front foot?

Lucas Alario told the Bundesliga website that Bayern will not surprise them on Saturday. “You have to play these games. We know their strength, the physical and technical quality they have all over the pitch. But we also have our game, and we’ve shown it against great teams. So, we’ll try and do our best to win the game.” Hansi Flick has doubts concerning Leon Goretzka’s fitness but Robert Lewandowski, fresh from being named as FIFA’s best player will lead Bayern’s charge as they seek to overtake Leverkusen, who lead the division by one point and want to go into 2021 as winter champions. Leverkusen have the stingiest defence while Bayern are the high scorers – what will give on Saturday?

In clashes against Inter Milan and AC Milan this season, Napoli have contrived to lose, despite a majority of possession and the creation of good scoring chances. Against a Lazio team who only know how to attack in droves, but have scored just seven times in their first six home matches. Lazio manager, Simone Inzaghi knows that returning to winning at the Stadio Olimpico is very key to where they will end the season and a good win against one of the likely contenders for the Scudetto will boost his squad’s confidence? But can Lazio turn on their scoring momentum against a Napoli side that have won four of their six away matches?

When they host the Parisians on Sunday, Lille will have the chance to go four points clear with a win. That is a gargantuan task because Christophe Galtier’s side boast of just one win against the multiple champions in their last 15 meetings. The manager said: “We’ll have the same level of fatigue and in a one-off match anything is possible. The match comes along at the right time,” while Thomas Tuchel said they were lucky to beat Lorient “and the end of this calendar year is a bit tricky.” Tuchel will be without Neymar, but Kylian Mbappe is back and scored in the midweek win over Lorient. It looks like Tuchel cannot afford another terrible loss as he is in danger of losing his role. Will Lille send Tuchel packing?
