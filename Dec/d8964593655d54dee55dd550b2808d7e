The police in Oyo State, South-west Nigeria, on Sunday confirmed the kidnap of two foreigners in Ibadan, the state capital. PREMIUM TIMES gathered that the two foreigners, who are Indians, were kidnapped on Wednesday. The whereabouts of the victims are still unknown as of the time of this report. PREMIUM TIMES learnt that the two foreigners were kidnapped around 4 p.m. on Wednesday. They were kidnapped at a pharmaceutical firm near Toll Gate on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. They were said to be driving out of the company’s premises when the kidnappers, who were trailing them, opened fire on their vehicle’s tyres which forced the vehicles to a halt. Their abduction joins a growing list of people, foreigners and Nigerians, kidnapped across Nigeria daily. The latest such abduction was the kidnap of a yet to be confirmed number of secondary school students in Katsina State on Saturday. Kidnapping for ransom has become common in many parts of Nigeria.
