The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has approved new license categorisations for the payments system. A circular signed by Musa Jimoh, director, Payments System Management Department of the apex bank, says the new framework offers clarity for new and existing market participants. “Given the significant evolution and innovation in the Nigerian payment system, all payment service providers and stakeholders are invited to note the following,” in this regard, the statement highlighted. “Payments system licensing has been streamlined according to permissible activities in four broad categories. “The categories are Switching and Processing, Mobile Money Operations (MMOs), Payment Service Solutions (PSSs) and Regulatory Sandbox,” he said. Mr Jimoh stated that only MMOs were permitted to hold customer funds, adding that companies with licenses within any of the other categories were not permitted to hold customer funds. He said that companies seeking to combine activities under the switching and MMO categories were only permitted to operate under a Holden company structure with subsidiaries clearly delineated. “Payments system companies in the PSS category may hold any of the PSSP, PTSP, and Super Agent licence or a combination of the licences thereof. “All payment service providers and stakeholders in the payments system are required to ensure strict compliance with these requirements and all other payment system regulations,” he said.
