The stage is now set for the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 draws as the flagship club competition enters the knockout phase. Some big clubs that have previously won the Champions League, like Manchester United, Inter Milan and Ajax, failed to pull through the group stage. Nonetheless, none of the teams left in contention are debutants in this stage of the competition, thus giving room for expectations for balanced games going forward. Defending champions Bayern Munich are top on the list of seeded teams, same as beaten finalists PSG. For the round of 16, only one recognisable Nigerian player, Zaidu Sanusi, is in contention with FC Porto. Meanwhile, at this phase, there is no country protection, so the remaining teams can face anyone, including facing a club from the same country. However, clubs that were in the same group with each other in the group phase cannot meet in this round. So, Juventus, for example, cannot get Barcelona. Seeded teams… Strongest side here?
