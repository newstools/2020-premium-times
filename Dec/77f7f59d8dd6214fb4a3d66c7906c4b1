President Muhammadu Buhari has come under severe criticism on social media, particularly Twitter, over the kidnap of students at the Government Boys Science Secondary School in Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State. PREMIUM TIMES reported that the gunmen who came on motorbikes invaded the school’s premises around 11 p.m. Friday night, shooting indiscriminately to scare residents. The operation led to the disappearance of many students, residents said. Although the state police confirmed the incident, it did not disclose the number of students that were kidnapped. Following the attack, the governor of Katsina State, Aminu Masari, on Saturday, ordered the closure of all boarding secondary schools in the state. “The situation goes beyond one’s thinking. It’s a sad moment for Katsina, I am assuring parents of the missing students we will do anything humanly possible to rescue the children, it’s our responsibility to protect lives and properties. “As I am speaking to you now, the soldiers are in the bush engaging the militants in a fire fight, I plead with you to exercise patience, we will rescue the children and I also ordered for the closure of all schools to save the children,” he said. President Buhari also acknowledged the attack, saying security agencies were engaging the isnurgents in battles to ensure anyone kidnapped was freed. The president also ordered an audit to determine the exact number of missing students. The attack on the school and kidnap of the students is the latest such case in the country where insecurity is rife and killings and kidnappings common. Apart from the ongoing Boko Haram insurgency in the North-east, bandits attack communities in the North-west and North-central states at will, killing and kidnapping residents. Kidnappings have also become commonplace in other parts of the country. Nigerians, using the hashtag #BringBackOurBoys on Twitter, lamented the security situation, and criticised President Muhammadu Buhari’s handling of it. They also demanded the removal of the service chiefs, Many Nigerian also called on the president, who is currently in Katsina, to show empathy by visiting the scene of the incident. Below are some of the reactions of Nigerians on Twitter. Kai @MBuhari you're still in Daura but you can't even go to Kankara to show your sympathy for the families of the victims. You're a failure, you're so heartless and wicked president. You already shows your level of inhumanity, and lack of sympathy. #BringBackOurBoys — PRINCESS ZARAH (@XahraBKumbo) December 13, 2020  Yes you can say it doesn’t concern you but tomorrow it could be your brother abducted, From economy to transportation to security Buhari has failed us all!  #BringBackOurBoys — Uncle chu (@chubiei) December 13, 2020  Breaking news!!!

Under his nose, bandits attacked a school. Hundreds of students are allegedly missing. All he does is issue a statement. He can’t even visit the school for an on the spot assessment?#BringBackOurBoys#BringBackOurBoys#BringBackOurBoys — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) December 13, 2020  If I were Buhari I would've called all the SeviceChiefs and give them 24hrs to bring back the abducted students,or else I sack them and imprison them all. #SaveKankaraStudents #BringBackOurBoys — Local Mαɳ (@Sir__MbO) December 12, 2020    To think the bandits kidnapped 600 students in a state where the president and his guards are currently at is disturbing, what is more disturbing is the students are still with the bandits after 24hrs. This govt has to change it’s way of fighting insecurities.#BringBackOurBoys — Al'ameen (@Al_ameen_Yabo) December 13, 2020  Can you imagine the was in katsina when the bandits abducted the students.
