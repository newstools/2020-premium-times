The Interpol global police coordination agency on Wednesday warned that organised criminal networks could be targeting COVID-19 vaccines, and could look to sell fake shots. Interpol, with headquarters in France, said it had issued a global alert to law enforcement agencies across its 194 member countries. This was to alert them to prepare for organised crime networks targeting COVID-19 vaccines, both physically and online. “As governments are preparing to roll out vaccines, criminal organisations are planning to infiltrate or disrupt supply chains. “Criminal networks will also be targeting unsuspecting members of the public via fake websites and false cures, which could pose a significant risk to their health, even their lives,’’ said Interpol secretary general Juergen Stock.
