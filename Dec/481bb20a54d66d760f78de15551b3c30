APIN Public Health Initiatives, a leading nongovernmental organization that designs and executes projects to reduce the burden of diseases and public health challenges in Nigeria, commissions its new corporate headquarters and announces that come January 2021, it will officially commence operations at the new location in Apo Resettlement Zone E, Abuja. Since the organization started as a project of the Harvard School of Public Health nearly twenty years ago, the staff strength and scope of operations have grown exponentially. The new headquarters will provide the much-needed workspace for APIN’s fast-growing team to explore and contribute to current and emerging public health issues. This strategic move will also allow the organization to leverage and build on its experience implementing interventions and projects in thematic areas such as HIV/AIDS and Maternal and Child Health, and pursue a more diverse range of opportunities within the development and humanitarian space. The new headquarters located at Plot 1551, Apo Resettlement Zone E reflects APIN’s innovative work culture and features a modern, spacious design with state-of-the-art, technology-enabled workspaces that will accelerate collaboration between onsite and offsite colleagues, partners and external stakeholders while allowing further room for growth. <img data-attachment-id="430062" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/promoted/430056-apin-public-health-initiatives-commissions-new-headquarters.html/attachment/ribbon" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/12/ribbon.jpg?fit=1254%2C706&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1254,706" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Ribbon-cutting and Commissioning event led by Pastor Hendricks Echoga, APIN Public Health Initiatives Board members and Senior Management Team" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;Caption:  Ribbon-cutting and Commissioning event led by Pastor Hendricks Echoga, APIN Public Health Initiatives Board members and Senior Management Team &lt;/p&gt;
