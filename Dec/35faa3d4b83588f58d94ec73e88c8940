He also directed spouses of the graduates to come decorate their partners. 12:05 p.m The special guest of honour, Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, who is representing the President, takes to the podium to deliver his speech. Mr Lalong congratulates the graduating class on the successful completion of their course. He said the need for high quality strategic thinking and action across the public and private sectors has never been greater. He said the COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on the global economy resulting in increasing expenditure on healthcare and related infrastructure and disruptions to supply chains. Mr Lalong said measures taken to contain the virus have also had the effect of a fall in the demand for crude oil and an unprecedented oil price crash. Mr Lalong said the facts and figures are to remind the graduates of the tasks ahead. He said innovation and creative intelligence from the graduates is needed, to address national challenges. Mr Lalong said the institution was founded to empower decision makers and executives across the public and private sector. He noted that the selection process is deliberately competitive and the workload is intentionally rigorous. He said the fast growing young and dynamic population that feels disempowered, is a threat to stability. “This calls for the expansion of access to opportunity and investment in human capital development (on) a scale that is unprecedented in our history,” he said. Mr Lalong said the government has adopted new ethics of collaborations, in which the public sector sees its role as enabling the private sector to perform optimally. He said the reputation of the government as predatory and rent-seeking was derived from the interaction between entrepreneurs and government institutions. Mr Lalong said this has led to some unfortunate situations. He urged everyone to dismantle all such roadblocks of rent seeking as impediments to doing lawful business in various spheres of influence. Mr Lalong also encouraged the graduates to serve as examples of progressive values to inspire others to take up the challenge. “The simple resolve that things should work under your watch will win you both friends and adversaries but the evidence of history is clear that change must first come from the margins before it can become mainstream,” he said. He urged the graduates to consolidate the associations and friendships established during the course. The co-anchor takes the podium to announce the closing of the ceremony. Everyone is up for the National Anthem. This brings us to the end of this live update. Thanks for staying with us.
