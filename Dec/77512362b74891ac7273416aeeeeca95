The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has declared Ibrahim Tudu of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as winner of the Bakura State constituency supplementary election in Zamfara. INEC Returning Officer for the election, Yahaya Tanko of Usmanu Danfodio University, Sokoto, said Mr Tudu polled 23,874 votes to win the election. “The candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Mr Dan-Kande Bello, polled 16,546 votes, while Mr Ibrahim Tudu of the PDP scored 23,874 votes and he has been declared elected,” he said. The state PDP chairperson, Tukur Dan-Fulani, who spoke to journalists shortly after the announcement, charged the winner to justify his victory by being a good ambassador of the party. The APC had on Tuesday announced that it was boycotting the election. Mr Ibrahim Birnin-Magaji, the state publicity secretary of the party, said at a briefing that the party was pulling out because it had lost confidence in INEC and security agencies in the state. (NAN)
