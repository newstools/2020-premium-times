With four days left for the year, Nigeria broke its existing record of highest weekly COVID-19 infections, a PREMIUM TIMES review of official data shows. Between Sunday and Saturday (December 20-26), the last full week of the year, Nigeria recorded 5,643 new cases, an eight per cent increase from the previous week’s record of 5,176. This increase followed the declaration of the second wave of the pandemic in Nigeria with state governments issuing directives on safety protocols and placing some restrictions. While experts and NCDC officials have attributed the rising cases to the disregard of the safety protocols, the increase in testing last week might have contributed to it. A total of 50,598 samples were collected for testing last week as against the 29,159 tested the previous week. Since the pandemic broke out in February, a total 925,215 samples have been collected for testing. Nevertheless, the public health agency and other sister agencies at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic, have urged Nigerians to take precautions particularly during this festive period. Further analysis also showed that the number of fatalities and COVID-19 patients discharged increased last week. A total of 2,711 persons recovered and were discharged last week, which represents a 28 per cent increase when compared to the previous week’s record of 1,934. Also, Nigeria recorded 29 deaths last week as against the 24 persons who died from COVID-19 complications in the previous week. As of the time of reporting, Nigeria has 83,576 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Of this figure, 70,495 have been discharged and 1,247 deaths have been recorded in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory.
