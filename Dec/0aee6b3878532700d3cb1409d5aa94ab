In the video, the boy pleaded with the Nigerian government to recall all the soldiers trying to rescue them from the terrorists. “The soldiers cannot do anything to them, I swear, stop sending even the fighter jet here,” the boy said, crying and calling for help. Other boys in the video were also seen and heard pleading from the background.
