Ten startups innovations in information technology selected by the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) will represent Nigeria at this year’s Feature Stars competition as part of the annual Gulf Information Technology Exhibition (GITEX). Last year, one of startups pitched for the awards by Nigeria, Chiniki, won the top prize for AI solutions at the 2019 GFS. The 40th edition of th exhibition opens on Sunday at the World Trade Centre in the United Arab Emirates’ city, with participants from over 80 countries. The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ibrahim, who inaugurated Nigeria’s pavilion at the exhibition grounds, expressed optimism on the viability of the startups selected to represent the country at the global competion. He said the purpose of Nigeria’s participation at the event was not just for the delegates to observe what was brought by others, but to also present the country’s innovation at the world stage. “As we all know, last year we won the first position in the category of artificial intelligence. I do hope that this yeat we are going to do the same or even better than what we have achieved last year,” the minister said. Mr Ibrahim admonished all participants to maximise the benefits of participating in the event through attending exhibitions, conferences and other learning opportunities. The minister also expressed hope that Nigeria’s attendance at the exhibition will aid the ministry and the country in implementing its National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) develped under Mr Ibrahim’s watch. NITDA, which is leading Nigeria’s participation at the exhibition, said GITEX 2020 was anchored on promoting youth-led enterprises to showcase innovations coming from its tech startups community, and the country’s strong policy-thrust on digital economy. The agency is offering full sponsorship to a number of startups across the country to participate in the Global Future Stars (GFS), a major highlight of GITEX 2020 offering a veritable window for the country’s startup community to leverage international exposure, attaract investors and mentorship NITDA director general, Kashifu Abdullahi, said the agency will be projecting its anchor-themes at the GITEX Africa Investment Forum (AIF) round exploring the new generation of entrepreneurs, investors and government leaders making the most of technology to continue bringing economic growth and prosperity to the continent generally, and Nigeria specifically. The 2020 GITEX AIF, according to the agency, is a one-day programme that will cover key tech trends across industries with representation from Nigeria and other parts of Africa. <img data-attachment-id="429704" data-permalink="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/business-news/429701-ten-nigerian-it-startups-compete-for-top-awards-in-dubai.html/attachment/h-4" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2020/12/h-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2560,1920" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-A805F&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1607265885&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;4.58&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.04&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ali Pantami cutting the tape to flag off Nigeria&#8217;s participation ay GITEX 2020 with him are the Director General of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Kashifu Abdullahi and theManaging Director of Galaxy Backbone, Prof. Muhammad Abubakar.
