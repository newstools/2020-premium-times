The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Tukur Buratai, has cancelled the remaining activities of the ongoing 2020 COAS Annual Conference following a positive test to COVID-19 on Tuesday by a participant, a statement issued on Thursday in Abuja said. The statement by the Acting Director, Army Public Relations, Sagir Musa, disclosed that as a result of this development, all the participants had been mandated to immediately proceed on self-isolation, in line with the federal government’s protocol on COVID -19, and to prevent any further spread of the disease. “All inconveniences hereby regretted please,” Mr Musa said.
