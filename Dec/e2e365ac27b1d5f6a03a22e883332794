The new non-executive director served as former group managing director (GMD) of legacy Mainstreet Bank Limited, and after the integration of the bank with Skye Bank Plc, held the position of deputy managing director until July 2016, when the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced changes on the board of the bank.

He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science and a Masters in Industrial and Labour Relations, both from the University of Ibadan. He had previously served as executive director at legacy Intercontinental Bank Plc, a non-executive director of Premium Pension Limited, and was a member of the governing council of Anambra State Investment Promotion and Protection Agency between 2014 and 2018. On his part, Mr Okeke is presently the MD of Azura Power West Africa Limited. He has over 19 years experience working for various blue-chip companies including Guinness Nigeria Plc, Lafarge Plc, Schlumberger Oilfield Services, and General Electric (GE). He obtained a bachelor’s degree in Electronic Engineering from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN) and an MBA from Imperial College, London. In its disclosure, the bank said the appointments of Mrs Onwughalu and Mr Nweke have been approved by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Mr Okeke’s appointment is awaiting CBN approval, it added. Commenting on the development, Mustafa Chike-Obi, Fidelity Bank’s chairperson, said: “We are very delighted to welcome the newly appointed Directors to the Fidelity family. These appointments end the on-going board realignment, occasioned by the retirements that had to happen, in line with our governance policies. We look forward to leveraging on the multi-disciplinary experiences of Amaka, Nelson and Chinedu in executing the next growth phase of Fidelity Bank”. Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .
