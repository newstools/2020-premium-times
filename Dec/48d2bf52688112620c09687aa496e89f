While in Nigeria, where he was born and schooled, Jaè Yalley, 27-year-old Nigerian-Ghanaian, did not vote in the elections he was eligible to participate in. Mr Yalley, a creative director and producer who says he is more Nigerian than Ghanaian, did not vote, despite registering, because he does not believe in elections in Nigeria and he feared for his safety. “I never voted while I was in Nigeria because it is not safe. Also, I do not believe in the system of voting in Nigeria,” Mr Yalley, who had his ordinary and higher national diplomas from electrical and electronic engineering at Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH), Lagos, said. If Mr Yalley’s citation of violence and disruptions during elections is singled out, it lends credence to a 2018 report by Crisis Group which estimated that between 2006 to 2015, about 4,000 lives were lost during elections in Nigeria. But less than two years after Mr Yalley relocated permanently to Accra, the capital of Ghana, a presidential election was held in his second home. Born to a Fante father, in western Ghana, and a Yoruba mother, in south-western Nigeria, not only did he vote in the election that was held December 7, all his family members of voting age voted too. “The election in Ghana is very transparent compared to Nigeria,” he said of his motivation to vote for the first time since he came of age. “The participatory spirit of the youth here and that of women is a motivation,” he added. “The incumbent president’s implementation of free high school education is another.” Professionally known as Doctor Jaèy, Mr Yalley is one of the over 13.4 million Ghanaians who turned out to vote at the nation’s presidential election about a fortnight ago which re-elected incumbent Nana Akufo-Addo. The 13.4 million who voted were from the 17 million eligible voters, representing about 79 per cent turnout, as announced by electoral chairwoman Jean Mensah. The latest election turnout is Ghana’s third-highest rate since the West African country returned to democratic rule in 1992 – the highest being in 2004, 85 per cent and 2012, 80 per cent. Another Ghanaian, Harry Ahovi, said he voted because “it is my right to vote… I want my vote to count because one vote can cause a change.” !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();</p>
<p> According to the data from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), turnout in the 1992 election returned a conservative figure of 50 per cent; in 1996, it increased to 78 per cent; by 2000, it fell to 62 per cent; in 2008, it rose again to 73 per cent; and fell to 69 per cent in 2016. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();</p>
<p> On the average, this means that about seven in ten Ghanaian eligible voters have voted in all its eight presidential elections in the past three decades.   !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();</p>
<p> To Ghana’s East, and separated by only the Benin Republic and Togo, is Nigeria — a country about four times the size of Ghana and seven times its population — where about five in ten have turned up to vote since its transition to civil rule in 1999. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();</p>
<p> Relative to its population, the turnout in Nigeria for elections is less than five in ten. In Ghana, it is more than seven in ten. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();</p>
<p> Data from the IDEA shows that there has been a consecutive decline in election turnout in Nigeria, which peaked at 69 per cent in 2003 from 52 per cent in 1999. Since the 2003 presidential election, participatory levels of Nigerians in subsequent elections have continued to decline, first to 57 per cent in 2007, then to 54 per cent in 2011, before dropping to 44 per cent in 2015 and 34.75 per cent in the 2019 presidential election, according to electoral umpire, INEC. !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px 0 8px auto; text-align: right; display: block; clear: both;'>
