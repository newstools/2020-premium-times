The daily number of new coronavirus (COVID-19) infections and deaths has hit new highs in the U.S.
On Wednesday, December 16, there were 247,403 new infections and 3,656 deaths with confirmed COVID-19 infection registered within the past 24 hours, a data released on Thursday, December 17 by the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in Baltimore said. The highest values before those 233,133 new cases and 3,306 deaths were recorded on December 11, 2020. In total, around 16.9 million people have been proven to be infected with the COVID-19 in the country with around 330 million inhabitants. Since the beginning of the pandemic, no fewer than 307,500 people have died from the COVID-19 pandemic. In absolute terms, that is more than in any other country in the world. The Johns Hopkins University website is updated regularly and therefore shows a higher level than the official figures from the World Health Organisation (WHO). In some cases, the numbers include those of new infections within 24 hours, but also those of the dead are updated retrospectively.(dpa/NAN)
