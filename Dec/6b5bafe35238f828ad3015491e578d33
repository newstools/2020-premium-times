The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) has begun to liquidate 42 microfinance banks (MFBs) across the country. The liquidation exercise followed the revocation of their licences by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the corporation said in a statement. The NDIC noted further that it would commence the verification of claims of stakeholders of the affected institutions on Monday. The verification exercise would hold at the branches of the microfinance banks and would involve meeting with the depositors, creditors, and shareholders of the banks to authenticate their deposits, among other concerns.

However, NDICâ€™s Executive Director of Corporate Services, Omolola Abiola-Edewor, lamented judgments against the corporation for liabilities with respect to failed banks under liquidation While speaking at the opening ceremony of the 2020 sensitisation seminar for judges of the Federal High Court in Abuja, Ms Abiola-Edewor said it was a major challenge confronting the deposits insurer. She blamed the limited understanding and the widespread misconception of the Deposit Insurance System (DIS) in the country as largely responsible for the pool of unclaimed deposits that often trail bank closures.
