The social media has been agog for the past few hours following the inability of internet users to access Google services in different countries of the world lunchtime on Monday. There were various comments on Twitter on Monday afternoon that Google services which include Gmail, Google Docs and YouTube went simultaneously down. Many users took to social media to ask if the challenges were personal or common to others. But comments suggested that similar challenges were faced in Nigeria, United States of America, India, South Africa, and Australia among many other countries. Before now, some internet services such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp have experienced downtimes. Meanwhile, Google was yet to officially react to the accessibility of its services as of the time of this report. Its services have, however, been restored in Nigeria.
