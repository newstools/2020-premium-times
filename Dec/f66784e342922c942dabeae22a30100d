Last week, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) conducted nine state House of Assembly and six senatorial by-elections across 11 states. The senatorial by-elections were conducted in Bayelsa Central, Bayelsa West, Cross River North, Imo North, Lagos East, and Plateau South senatorial districts. The state assembly elections were conducted in Bauchi, Enugu, Kogi, Borno, Cross Rivers, Katsina, Zamfara, and Lagos states. Of the six senatorial by-elections, four were conducted to occupy legislative seats that became vacant due to the death of their former occupants. These are Cross River North, Imo North, Lagos East, and Plateau south. The remaining two senatorial by-elections were for Bayelsa Central and Bayelsa West, represented by Douye Diri and Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo respectively before they were elected as governor and deputy governor of the state respectively. The by-elections were carried out amidst conflicting court orders that sacked candidates of the PDP in the Cross River North senatorial district and candidates of the APC Imo North senatorial district. INEC had suspended the polls, earlier scheduled to hold in October, following the violence in many parts of the country, resulting from the #EndSARS protests against police brutality. The by-elections were rescheduled for December 5. Also, amid the growing cases of the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 70,000 COVID-19 cases in Nigeria, according to data from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), INEC went ahead with the exercise across 5,856 polling units spread across 34 local government areas in the states, with over three million voters registered for the polls. The electoral umpire assured of compliance with the COVID-19 protocols among voters, and observers, as well as the conduct of hitch-free elections. The protocols were, however, largely ignored during the elections. According to the election observer group, YIAGA Africa, the by-elections were marred by voter apathy and inducement, violence, and political dominance of the two major political parties APC and PDP. For instance, the APC won seven of the 11 seats in Lagos, Imo, Kogi, Plateau, Katsina, Bauchi, Borno, while the main opposition PDP won in Bayelsa, Enugu, Zamfara, and Cross Rivers states in the federal and state legislative bye-elections. PREMIUM TIMES examines the by-elections in the 11 states. About eight political parties contested in the by-elections in Kosofe constituency II of the State House of Assembly elections, while 12 political parties jostled for the Lagos East senatorial polls. The ruling APC won both by-elections. The elections were held following the demise of Bayo Oshinowo and Tunde Braimoh, who represented Lagos East and Kosofe II in the Senate and the state assembly respectively. About 1,261,673 voters were registered for the Lagos East senatorial bye-election, while the state constituent election had about 280,363 registered voters spread across the six registration areas (wards) located in Ketu-Alapere, Ikosi/Ketu, Isheri/Olowo-Ora, Agboyi I, Agboyi II and Odo-Ogun/Ajegunle. For the senatorial by-election, the APC candidate, Tokunbo Abiru, won with 89,204 votes, defeating his main challenger from the PDP, Babatunde Gbadamosi, who scored 11,257 votes. Femi Saheed of the APC also won the polls with 12,494 votes to beat his closest rival, Sikiru Alebiosu of the PDP, who got 2,068 votes, in the Kosofe 2 State House of Assembly by-election.   However, a PREMIUM TIMES analysis, showed that only about nine per cent of the voters across the five divisions of the Lagos East (Epe, Ibeju-Lekki, Kosofe, Somolu and Ikorodu), consisting of 71 wards and 1,928 polling units, showed up to vote in the senatorial by-election.

A total of 102, 336, votes were valid, while 2,069 votes were rejected. INEC conducted the Bauchi State Dass House of Assembly by-election following the death of its former occupant, Musa Baraza, then a member of the APC. Bala Lukshi of the APC was declared the winner after he polled 12,299 votes, defeating Lawal Wundi of the PDP who scored 11,062 votes. Of the 58,112 total registered voters across the 10 wards in the area, as announced by INEC, the election had a total 42.24 per cent voter turnout.

In Enugu State, INEC conducted the state House of Assembly by-election for the Isi-Uzo state constituency, following the death of its former occupant, Chijioke Ugwueze. About nine political parties, including three female candidates, contested the polls, with a total of 69,626 registered voters in the 11 wards, across 118 polling units. A female candidate, Amaka Ugwueze of the PDP, won the election, defeating her closest rival, Ejiofor Okwor of the APC.

INEC conducted two by-elections in Cross River. One was the Cross River North senatorial district by-election and the other was that of Obudu constituency. Both elections had nine and six candidates that contested in the elections respectively. The elections were held following the deaths of Rose Oko and Stephen Ukpukpen who represented Cross River North and Obudu in the senate and the state assembly respectively. For the senatorial by-election in Cross River North, INEC declared the PDP candidate, Stephen Odey, the winner despite two conflicting court orders: one confirmed Mr Odey as the PDP candidate and another court affirmed an aspirant, Jarigbe Jarigbe, as the true candidate of the PDP. Before the election, a Federal High Court in Cross River presided over by Justice S.A. Amobeda, affirmed Mr Odey as the candidate of the PDP for the by-election. Justice Amobeda, who gave the order, also directed INEC to publish the name of Mr Odey as the duly nominated candidate of the PDP to contest the election. On the same day, Justice Binta Mohammed of the FCT High Court declared Mr Jarigbe as the duly elected candidate of the PDP. But INEC while announcing the result said Mr Odey scored 129,207 votes to defeat nine candidates including Joe Agi of the APC who scored 19,165 votes.

The Returning Officer, Hakeem Adikum, announced that APC scored 36,811 votes, while Emmanuel Okewulonu of the PDP came second with 31,903 votes. The REC explained that INEC was unable to return a candidate from APC as the winner of the election because of the several court orders for and against Ifeanyi Araraume, whose name was contained in the final list of candidates produced by INEC. Apart from the controversies, the elections were also marred by a low voter turnout with 19.36 per cent of the 72,289 registered voters taking part.
