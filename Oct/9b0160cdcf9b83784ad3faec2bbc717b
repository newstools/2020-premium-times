An October 31 report on the looting of the home of the former House Speaker, Yakubu Dogara, published on this page, has been withdrawn. The story reported Mr Dogara as condemning and regretting the raid on his property in Lamingo, a suburb of Jos, the Plateau State capital. Mr Dogara has denied speaking with a PREMIUM TIMES’ representative in Plateau State. The article was withdrawn after an editorial review of the resources of its reporting, including records of messages to a telephone number Mr Dogara was known to have used as a member of the House of Representatives. A spokesperson has denied Mr Dogara currently uses that phone number. PREMIUM TIMES’ unwavering commitment to informing its readers and holding power accountable is inseparable from its responsible pledge to providing quality journalism that is fair and accurate. Any inconvenience caused is regretted. Donate TEXT AD: To advertise here .
